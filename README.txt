-------------------------------
A simple shooter I made in a week, some years ago.
-------------------------------
Programmed in C++ using SDL, SDL_image, OpenGL, Glu32. Original was using SDL_mixer for a 
song, but I removed it because of licensing. I also removed all SDL_mixer calls, so you
don't need it to compile.
